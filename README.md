capstone project 2018


This site is a web application project was created as a concept site for a business called Jazzervations.  The purpose of this site it to accept and process customer reservations for a concert hall.  The web application allows customers to enter information, choose what section they want to purchase the tickets in, and also enter ticket order delivery type information. This project uses HTML5, CSS3, JSP, and MySQL to accept the customer input into a form, process and calculate price based on information entered, display purchase confirmation information to the customer, and keep track of ticket sales and information in a database. I was the lead front-end developer for this project, and help assist with back-end processing of the application. for developing the web design and forms.
